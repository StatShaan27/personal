      <h2><a href="https://www.icbms.org/" target="_blank">Bishop Morrow School, Krishnagar</a></h2>
      <p><strong>Years:</strong> KG – Class 10</p>
      <p>
        The place where it all began. Tucked away in the quiet lanes of Krishnagar, Bishop Morrow was more than just a school to me. 
        It was my first encounter with structure, with morning prayers, with blackboards that didn’t always erase cleanly. 
        I spent over a decade here — the foundational years. Between classroom monotony and inter-house quiz competitions, 
        it gave me a solid grounding, and a lot of stories.

      <h2>Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Kolkata</h2>
      <p><strong>Years:</strong> Class 11 – 12</p>
      <p>
        Transitioning to Bhavan's felt like moving from a sleepy river to a swift current. 
        The rigor kicked in — Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology all vying for my time. 
        The expectations were high, the exam pressure was real, but so was the self-discipline it cultivated. 
        Bhavan's shaped me into a more focused, independent learner — and prepared me for the storm that was ISI.

      <h2>Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata</h2>
      <p><strong>Years:</strong> B.Stat (Ongoing)</p>
      <p>
        ISI — the name I once only read on Olympiad posters, now my everyday reality. 
        It’s intense. Unforgiving at times. Yet intellectually electric. 
        Courses that force you to think, professors who challenge assumptions, peers who constantly raise the bar. 
        There are days of doubt, but more days of discovery. I don’t know how these years will read in hindsight, 
        but they’re certainly transforming me — one theorem, one error, one breakthrough at a time.
