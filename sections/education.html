    The place where it all began. Tucked away in the lanes of Krishnagar, Bishop Morrow wasn’t just my school — it was my first home, not the second. The tiled corridors, the echoing bell, the ever-serious prefects, and the discipline drills every morning shaped more than just my habits — they shaped my attitude. The school demanded sincerity and neat handwriting, and in return gave back stories, friendships, and the joy of tiny wins.
  </p>
  <p>
    I served as the Junior Bosco House Captain, but leadership came through more than just the badge — through responsibilities, morning assemblies, and keeping your house flag upright. I was actively involved in cultural events: hosting programmes, poem recitations, storytelling, drama, dance, group singing, quizzes — you name it. BMS always encouraged participation, and I was rarely one to sit out.
  </p>
  <p>
    The blackboards didn’t always erase well, but the lessons stuck. More than a decade here taught me to value punctuality, respect, and the ability to speak on stage without shaking like a leaf. Looking back, it wasn’t just a school — it was my training ground.

      <p><strong>Years:</strong> Class 11 – 12</p>
      </p> <p> I moved to Kolkata for these crucial two years — a shift driven by my enrollment at the FIITJEE North Kolkata Centre for JEE prep. My heart was always set on ISI, but with the dauntingly low number of seats, preparing for JEE seemed like a rational backup plan. </p> <p> While many opted for dummy schools with lax schedules, I chose Bhavan's — a school where attendance was taken seriously. That decision paid off. Thanks to incredible teachers who genuinely enjoyed teaching, I ended up clearing most of my basics during school hours itself. </p> <p> But the academic part was just half the story. What truly shaped my Bhavan's experience was the people — a peer group that believed in collaboration over competition. We helped each other grow, academically and emotionally, steering clear of the toxic rat race. </p> <p> Though I spent only two years here, the friendships, the laughter, and the quiet support of the faculty have left a permanent mark. Bhavan’s will always be more than just a school — it’s a warm memory that reminds me how right decisions sometimes look like risks. </p>

      <p>
        I first heard about ISI from my schoolteachers in Krishnagar. I was drawn to mathematics early on — not because I wanted to be ahead, but because it just made more sense than rote learning. It was logical, structured, and fair. My journey led me through the IOQM (then called Pre-RMO), and as I explored deeper, I came across names like CMI and ISI. ISI stood out — something about it felt like the right fit.

Now that I'm here, I know I wasn’t wrong. ISI Kolkata sits quietly on the city's edge, away from the glamour of typical college life. No flashy fests, no overdone drama. What you’ll find instead is a quiet dedication — people engrossed in problems, proofs, and discussions that stretch well into the evening.

It’s academically intense — no sugar-coating that — but I find comfort in its simplicity, in the support from peers and seniors, and in the unspoken understanding that everyone’s here because they truly like what they study. It’s a tough climb, but if passion counts for anything, I think I’m on the right path.
